# The name
OCOS stants for "Optifine Capes On Sodium". I'm developing it because all players deserve to see Optifine capes, whether they use it or not.

# My reasoning
I have a **TERRIBLE** laptop. And so I like to stick with Sodium, but I want the Optifine benifits, I have a cape and everything. That's why this exists.
